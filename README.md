# Welcome to My GitHub Page

I was born and raised in Hanoi, and I pursued my studies in Computational Physics at the VNU University of Science (Hanoi University of Science). My graduation thesis was centered on **"Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells"**, where I built and calculated the structure of ethylene fluorine ethylene (C₂H₄)n membranes.

I have a deep passion for **atomic structure simulations** and had the privilege of participating in molecular structure simulation tutorials led by **[Professor Jer-Lai Kuo](https://sites.google.com/site/jlkiams/)**. Following this, I worked as a Research Assistant in his lab at the **Institute of Atomic and Molecular Sciences**, Academia Sinica, Taiwan.
